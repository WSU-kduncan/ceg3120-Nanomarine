Setup
  You can get an API token from the "Bot" section after you have selected the correct application.
  You must create a .env file and add this line "DISCORD_TOKEN={your-bot-token}" where "your-bot-token" is your bot token
  You'll need to install python-dotenv and discord.py
  
Usage
  You type "!hitme" and you are blessed with a Futurama quote, including Benders most famous line "Bite my shiny metal a$$!"
Research
  Some things I found would be to buy a rasperry pi or to subscribe to some cloud service to host your script. These would both be viable as long as the cloud service doesn't go down and the pi stays powered.
